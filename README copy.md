# Expo mobile app to display my documentation portfolio

Run this React Native mobile app to view my technical writing portfolio on your Apple iPhone. This portfolio includes links to live documentation I authored.

I set up my portfolio using [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) so that you could view it on your phone, if desired.

The [Expo](https://expo.dev) Go app is a sandbox mobile application that enables you to preview React Native applications on a mobile device without the need for a full development environment.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not want to install the Expo Go app on your phone, you can still view my portfolio!
> Go to [https://storied-semifreddo-5b2900.netlify.app/](https://storied-semifreddo-5b2900.netlify.app/). Enjoy.
